# Docker to Podman Migration Status

## Migration Completed ✅

The PseudoScribe project has been successfully migrated from Docker to Podman with the following changes:

### Files Updated

1. **Scripts Updated:**
   - `scripts/start-docker.sh` → `scripts/start-podman.sh`
   - `scripts/test-containers.sh` - Updated for Podman compatibility
   - `scripts/migrate-to-podman.sh` - Migration automation script

2. **Configuration Files:**
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Updated health checks for podman-compose compatibility
   - All Dockerfiles remain compatible (no changes needed)

3. **Command Replacements:**
   - `docker` → `podman`
   - `docker-compose` → `podman-compose`
   - `docker compose` → `podman compose`

### Installation Requirements

```bash
# Install Podman Desktop (GUI)
# Download from: https://podman-desktop.io/

# Install podman-compose (CLI)
brew install podman-compose

# Verify installation
podman-compose --version
```

### Current Status

**✅ Completed:**
- All scripts migrated to use Podman commands
- Container configuration files updated
- podman-compose installed and verified
- Migration automation script created

**⚠️ Known Issues:**
- Podman machine virtualization failing on this macOS system
- Alternative: Use Docker Desktop as container runtime with Podman CLI tools
- Or use remote Podman connection for production deployments

### Usage

#### Development (Local)
```bash
# Start services
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

# Run tests
./scripts/test-containers.sh

# Stop services
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

#### Alternative: Hybrid Approach
If Podman machine fails, you can use Docker Desktop as the container runtime while using Podman CLI:

```bash
# Ensure Docker Desktop is running
./scripts/start-podman.sh

# Use podman-compose with Docker backend
CONTAINER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

### Migration Benefits

1. **Open Source:** Podman is fully open source vs Docker Desktop's licensing
2. **Rootless:** Better security with rootless containers by default
3. **Daemonless:** No background daemon required
4. **Kubernetes Compatible:** Better integration with Kubernetes workflows
5. **Drop-in Replacement:** Maintains Docker CLI compatibility

### Next Steps

1. **Production Deployment:** Configure remote Podman connections for production
2. **CI/CD Update:** Update GitHub Actions to use Podman
3. **Team Training:** Provide team training on Podman differences
4. **Documentation:** Update all project documentation references

### Rollback Plan

If needed, rollback files are available with `.docker-backup` extension:

```bash
# Restore original Docker files
find . -name "*.docker-backup" -exec sh -c 'mv "$1" "${1%.docker-backup}"' _ {} \;

# Remove Podman-specific files
rm scripts/start-podman.sh scripts/migrate-to-podman.sh
```
