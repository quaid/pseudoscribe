# TDD Workflow

Start a TDD (Test-Driven Development) workflow for the feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow Steps

1. **Understand the requirement**: Analyze what needs to be built
2. **Write failing test(s)**: Create test cases that define expected behavior
3. **Run tests**: Confirm tests fail (Red phase)
4. **Implement minimal code**: Write just enough code to pass tests
5. **Run tests**: Confirm tests pass (Green phase)
6. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
7. **Commit**: Create atomic commits for each cycle

## Guidelines

- Start with the simplest test case
- One test at a time
- Keep implementations minimal
- Refactor only when tests are green
- Use descriptive test names
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
