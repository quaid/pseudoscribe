---

Use the mcp__google-analytics__search_schema tool to find relevant GA4 dimensions and metrics.

This is the most efficient way to discover what data you can query from Google Analytics.

Example queries:
- "user" - Find user-related dimensions/metrics
- "campaign revenue" - Find campaign and revenue metrics
- "page" - Find page-related dimensions
- "session" - Find session metrics
- "conversion" - Find conversion tracking fields

Usage:
1. Ask the user what they want to analyze
2. Use this tool to search for relevant dimensions/metrics
3. Show the user the available fields
4. Proceed with data retrieval using /ga-get-data

Key benefit: Returns only the most relevant fields without overwhelming with the entire schema.
