Feature: VSC-007 Performance Optimization
  As an SRE, I need metrics
  As a user, I need speed
  
  Background:
    Given the PseudoScribe service is running
    And the VSCode extension is active
    And performance monitoring is enabled

  @performance @monitoring
  Scenario: Monitor real-time performance metrics
    Given the system is actively processing requests
    When I track performance metrics
    Then CPU usage should be collected
    And memory usage should be tracked
    And response times should be measured
    And API latency should be monitored
    And metrics should be stored with timestamps
    And SLA compliance should be verified

  @performance @optimization
  Scenario: Optimize system performance based on metrics
    Given I have collected performance data over time
    And I identify performance bottlenecks
    When I apply optimization strategies
    Then API response latency should be reduced by at least 20%
    And memory usage should be optimized
    And CPU utilization should be more efficient
    And user experience should improve measurably

  @performance @sla
  Scenario: Verify SLA compliance for critical operations
    Given performance monitoring is active
    When I check SLA compliance for critical operations
    Then AI operations should complete within 2 seconds
    And live suggestions should respond within 500ms
    And extension load time should be under 1 second
    And API endpoints should respond within 200ms
    And WebSocket connections should establish within 1 second

  @performance @alerts
  Scenario: Performance degradation alerts
    Given performance thresholds are configured
    When system performance degrades beyond acceptable limits
    Then alerts should be triggered immediately
    And performance metrics should be logged
    And degradation should be categorized by severity
    And recovery recommendations should be provided

  @performance @resource-optimization
  Scenario: Resource usage optimization
    Given the system is under normal load
    When I analyze resource utilization patterns
    Then memory leaks should be detected and prevented
    And unnecessary resource consumption should be identified
    And optimization recommendations should be generated
    And resource usage should be within acceptable limits

  @performance @load-testing
  Scenario: Performance under load
    Given the system is configured for load testing
    When I simulate high concurrent user load
    Then response times should remain within SLA limits
    And system should handle load gracefully
    And no memory leaks should occur
    And error rates should remain below 1%
    And system should recover quickly after load reduction

  @performance @caching
  Scenario: Implement intelligent caching for performance
    Given frequently accessed data is identified
    When I implement caching strategies
    Then cache hit rates should be above 80%
    And cache invalidation should work correctly
    And memory usage for caching should be optimized
    And overall system performance should improve

  @performance @database
  Scenario: Database query optimization
    Given database queries are being monitored
    When I analyze query performance
    Then slow queries should be identified and optimized
    And database connection pooling should be efficient
    And query response times should meet SLA requirements
    And database resource usage should be optimized

  @performance @real-time
  Scenario: Real-time performance monitoring dashboard
    Given performance metrics are being collected
    When I view the performance dashboard
    Then real-time metrics should be displayed
    And historical trends should be visible
    And performance alerts should be shown
    And system health status should be clear
    And actionable insights should be provided

  @performance @user-experience
  Scenario: User experience performance optimization
    Given user interactions are being tracked
    When I analyze user experience metrics
    Then UI responsiveness should be optimized
    And user wait times should be minimized
    And interaction feedback should be immediate
    And overall user satisfaction should improve
