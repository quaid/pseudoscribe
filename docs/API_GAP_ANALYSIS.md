# API Gap Analysis: Working vs. Stub/Mock APIs

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current state of APIs in the Pseudoscribe project, identifying which components are fully implemented versus those that are still using stubs or mocks.

## Fully Implemented APIs

1. **MarkdownProcessor** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/markdown_processor.py`)
   - Complete implementation with comprehensive functionality for parsing, extracting, and transforming markdown content
   - All methods have proper error handling and logging
   - Passes all tests in `test_markdown_processor.py`

2. **VaultSync** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/vault_sync.py`)
   - Complete implementation for interacting with Obsidian vaults
   - Includes methods for initializing, scanning, reading/writing notes, extracting links, building graphs, and syncing changes
   - Robust error handling and caching mechanisms

3. **OllamaService** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/ollama_service.py`)
   - Full implementation for interacting with Ollama AI service
   - Includes methods for listing models, loading models, generating text, streaming generation, and getting model info
   - Proper error handling with HTTP exceptions
   - Comprehensive test coverage in `test_ollama_service.py`

## Partially Implemented APIs

1. **VectorStore** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/vector_store.py`)
   - Basic implementation for storing and retrieving vectors with similarity search
   - Uses in-memory storage (not persistent)
   - Missing advanced features like batch operations, persistence, and optimized similarity search algorithms
   - Likely needs integration with a proper vector database for production

2. **ModelManager** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/model_manager.py`)
   - Partial implementation with some working functionality
   - Includes methods for model management, vector generation, and context ranking
   - Some methods appear to be fully implemented while others may be stubs
   - Integration with OllamaService is implemented, but some advanced features may be stubs

3. **RoleManager** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/role_manager.py`)
   - Basic implementation for role management
   - Includes CRUD operations for roles but may lack advanced features
   - Integration with API endpoints is implemented

## Stub/Mock APIs

1. **StyleProfiler** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/style_profiler.py`)
   - Implementation appears to be mostly stubs
   - Core methods like `analyze_text()` reference mock objects (`self.model_manager.generate_vector.return_value`)
   - In-memory storage for profiles instead of persistent storage
   - Comments indicate "In a real implementation, this would be awaited"

2. **StyleChecker** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/style_checker.py`)
   - Depends on StyleProfiler which is mostly stubs
   - Implements logic for style checking but relies on mock data
   - Core functionality is present but not connected to real data sources

3. **StyleAdapter** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/style_adapter.py`)
   - Based on file size and dependencies, likely contains stub implementations
   - Would depend on StyleProfiler and StyleChecker which are stubs

4. **VectorGenerator** (`pseudoscribe/infrastructure/vector_generator.py`)
   - Small file size (2030 bytes) suggests a stub implementation
   - Likely contains basic interface but not full implementation

## API Endpoints (Minimal Implementation)

1. **API App** (`pseudoscribe/api/app.py`)
   - Minimal implementation (368 bytes)
   - Likely just sets up the FastAPI application without full endpoint implementation

2. **Role API** (`pseudoscribe/api/role.py`)
   - Basic implementation for role management endpoints
   - Likely functional but may lack comprehensive error handling and validation

3. **Tenant Config API** (`pseudoscribe/api/tenant_config.py`)
   - Basic implementation for tenant configuration
   - May lack comprehensive features and validation

## Implementation Priority Based on SCCS Workflow

Based on the Writer's Block Assistant Development Standards and SCCS workflow:

1. **Complete Style-Related Components**
   - StyleProfiler, StyleChecker, and StyleAdapter are core to the writing assistant functionality
   - These components have tests but implementations are mostly stubs
   - Priority: High

2. **Enhance Vector Storage and Generation**
   - VectorStore has a basic implementation but needs persistence
   - VectorGenerator appears to be a stub
   - These are critical for semantic search and context retrieval
   - Priority: High

3. **Finalize Model Management**
   - ModelManager is partially implemented but needs completion
   - Important for managing different AI models and versions
   - Priority: Medium

4. **Complete API Endpoints**
   - API endpoints have minimal implementation
   - Need to be fully implemented for a complete application
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Implement Tenant Middleware**
   - Tenant middleware is important for multi-tenant support
   - Currently has basic implementation
   - Priority: Low (unless multi-tenant support is a core requirement)

## Recommendations for Implementation

1. **Follow TDD Workflow**
   - Tests already exist for most components
   - Implement the components following the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
   - Ensure all tests pass before moving to the next component

2. **Focus on Core Functionality First**
   - Style-related components and vector operations are core to the writing assistant
   - Implement these first to enable the main functionality

3. **Ensure Proper Error Handling**
   - Many stub implementations lack comprehensive error handling
   - Ensure all implementations include proper error handling and logging

4. **Implement Persistence**
   - Many components use in-memory storage
   - Implement proper persistence mechanisms for production use

5. **Complete Documentation**
   - Ensure all components have comprehensive documentation
   - Update API documentation as implementations are completed

## Next Steps

1. Create a prioritized backlog of implementation tasks based on this analysis
2. Assign story points to each task following the SCCS estimation guidelines
3. Begin implementation following the TDD workflow (Red-Green-Refactor)
4. Ensure all implementations adhere to the Writer's Block Assistant Development Standards
