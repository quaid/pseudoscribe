# Cloud-Native Development Standards

## Overview
This document outlines the cloud-native development standards for the PseudoScribe project, ensuring consistent containerization, testing, and deployment practices.

## Container Standards

### 1. Dockerfile Best Practices
- **Multi-stage builds** for production optimization
- **Non-root user** execution for security
- **Minimal base images** (Alpine Linux preferred)
- **Layer caching optimization** with proper COPY ordering
- **Health checks** for all services
- **Security scanning** with Trivy or similar tools

### 2. Docker Compose Configuration
- **Environment-specific** compose files (dev, test, prod)
- **Service dependencies** properly defined
- **Resource limits** specified for all services
- **Named volumes** for persistent data
- **Network isolation** between services

### 3. Container Testing
- **Unit tests** run in containers
- **Integration tests** with service dependencies
- **End-to-end tests** in containerized environment
- **Performance testing** with resource monitoring
- **Security scanning** as part of CI/CD

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Test Hierarchy
```
Unit Tests (Fast, Isolated)
    ↓
Integration Tests (Service Dependencies)
    ↓
End-to-End Tests (Full System)
    ↓
Performance Tests (Load/Stress)
    ↓
Security Tests (Vulnerability Scanning)
```

### 2. Container Test Execution
- **Parallel test execution** where possible
- **Test isolation** with clean containers
- **Artifact collection** for failed tests
- **Coverage reporting** from containers
- **Test result aggregation** across services

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Standards
- **Branch protection** with required status checks
- **Automated testing** on all PRs
- **Container security scanning** before deployment
- **Performance regression** detection
- **Rollback capabilities** for failed deployments

## Service Architecture

### 1. Microservices Design
- **Single responsibility** per service
- **API-first** development approach
- **Event-driven** communication where appropriate
- **Circuit breaker** patterns for resilience
- **Distributed tracing** for observability

### 2. Configuration Management
- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **Secrets management** with proper encryption
- **Configuration validation** at startup
- **Hot reloading** where applicable
- **Configuration versioning** and rollback

### 3. Observability
- **Structured logging** with correlation IDs
- **Metrics collection** with Prometheus format
- **Health check endpoints** for all services
- **Distributed tracing** with OpenTelemetry
- **Alerting** based on SLIs/SLOs

## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development
- **Docker Compose** for local environment
- **Hot reloading** for development efficiency
- **Local testing** scripts for quick feedback
- **Environment parity** between dev/prod
- **Documentation** for setup and troubleshooting

### 2. Testing Workflow
```bash
# Local testing (fast feedback)
./scripts/local-test.sh

# Container testing (full environment)
./scripts/test-containers.sh

# CI/CD testing (automated)
GitHub Actions workflow
```

### 3. Deployment Standards
- **Blue-green deployments** for zero downtime
- **Rolling updates** with health checks
- **Canary releases** for risk mitigation
- **Infrastructure as Code** with version control
- **Automated rollback** on failure detection

## Security Standards

### 1. Container Security
- **Non-root user** execution
- **Minimal attack surface** with distroless images
- **Regular base image updates**
- **Vulnerability scanning** in CI/CD
- **Runtime security** monitoring

### 2. Network Security
- **Service mesh** for secure communication
- **TLS encryption** for all external traffic
- **Network policies** for service isolation
- **API gateway** for external access control
- **Rate limiting** and DDoS protection

### 3. Data Security
- **Encryption at rest** for sensitive data
- **Secrets management** with rotation
- **Data classification** and handling policies
- **Audit logging** for compliance
- **Backup encryption** and testing

## Performance Standards

### 1. Response Time Requirements
- **API endpoints**: < 2 seconds
- **Extension load time**: < 1 second
- **Database queries**: < 500ms
- **AI operations**: < 2 seconds
- **UI interactions**: < 100ms

### 2. Resource Limits
- **Memory baseline**: < 500MB per service
- **CPU usage**: < 80% under normal load
- **Disk I/O**: Optimized with caching
- **Network bandwidth**: Efficient data transfer
- **Container startup**: < 30 seconds

### 3. Scalability
- **Horizontal scaling** capability
- **Load balancing** across instances
- **Auto-scaling** based on metrics
- **Resource monitoring** and alerting
- **Capacity planning** and forecasting

## Compliance and Quality

### 1. Code Quality
- **Static analysis** with SonarQube or similar
- **Code coverage** > 80% for critical paths
- **Dependency scanning** for vulnerabilities
- **License compliance** checking
- **Documentation** standards enforcement

### 2. Operational Excellence
- **Incident response** procedures
- **Post-mortem** analysis and learning
- **Capacity planning** and monitoring
- **Disaster recovery** testing
- **Business continuity** planning
